Following important features of collection should me learned by any java developer!
=============================================================================
Hashset: unordered, unsorted, iterates in random order
Hashmap: not thread safe, unsorted, unordered
Hashtable: synchronized, thread safe, unsorted, unordered
Linkedlist: sorted, iteration is slower
LinkedHashSet: ordered, iterates in order of insertion
LinkedHashmap: slower insertion and deletion,faster insertion
ArrayList: Insertion and deletion are slower, not thread safe, random access
Vector: Threadsafe
Treemap: sorted order
LinkedList: iteration slower than ArrayList, fast insertion deletion
Treeset:  natural order, slower,sorted

StringBuilder and StringBuffer
===============================================
StringBuffer: Threadsafe , not immutable due to thread safety is little bit slower then StringBuilder
StringBuilder: not synchronized, not threadsafe, faster then StringBuffer.
